<center><p align="center">In the simplest terms, the term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or devices that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks that can improve themselves based on the information they collect .
It is also the specific behavior and characteristics of computer programs that make them simulate human mental capabilities and working patterns. Among the most important of these characteristics is the ability to learn, infer, and react to situations not programmed in the machine.</center>

<strong><p>•Narrow or limited artificial intelligence.</p></strong>
<p>   It refers to artificial intelligence systems that can only perform specific tasks independently and with capabilities that mimic human capabilities. This means that these systems are limited in capabilities and their capabilities do not go beyond the tasks designed for them.</p>
<strong> <p>•Artificial General Intelligence .</p></strong>
<p>               It means the ability of artificial intelligence to learn, perceive, understand and act just like a human by simulating human capabilities. These systems will be able to build a variety of capacities and reach links and generalizations across several areas, which would reduce much of the time needed to train these systems.</p>
