<p>-Conclusion, logical thinking, and the ability to solve problems .
The first researchers in artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the logical, logical reasoning that humans do when solving puzzles, playing table or logical conclusions. In the 1980s and 1990s, AI research led to very successful methods of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts of probability and economics.
For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require massive arithmetic resources - leading to a "fusion explosion": meaning that the amount of memory or time required for computers becomes an astronomer when the problem exceeds a certain size. The search for more problem solving algorithms is a top priority for AI research.Humans solve most of their problems by using quick, intuitive, and not conscious judgments, by a gradual deduction that enables the first researchers of artificial intelligence to simulate it automatically.
Research on artificial intelligence has made some progress in imitating this “sub-symbolic” type of problem-solving skills: the approaches involved include ensuring the importance of kinesthetic skills for superior thinking; research in the field of neural networks tries to simulate structures within the human and animal brain that lead to the emergence of This skill.

<header><h2><center>What is Artificial intelligence properties ?</center></h2></header>
<strong><p>Artificial intelligence has many properties that made it an effective investment in many areas:</strong>
<br>•The application of artificial intelligence to devices and machines enables it to plan and analyze problems using logic.
<br>•Learn about sounds and speech, and the ability to move things. 
<br>•AI adoption systems can understand and analyze inputs well to provide outputs that meet the user's needs very efficiently.
<br>•It enables continuous learning, whereby the learning process is automated and subjective without being monitored and supervised. 
<br>•He can handle the vast amount of information he is exposed to. He can observe similar patterns in data and analyze them more effectively than human brains. 
<br>•He can find solutions to unfamiliar problems using his cognitive abilities.
